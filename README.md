# Organization and Data Storage
For this project, I went with a Flaskified MVC architecture (models-static-templates, with all controlling done within [index.py](index.py)).
To save time, I used a data directory with json files to store club and user data.
The [clubs](data/clubs.json) file holds an array of objects, with each object representing a club.  Each club object has the keys 'name', 'description', 'tags', 'likes', and 'tagColors'.  Name and description are strings, tags is an array of tag name strings, likes is an int (representing the number of likes the club has), and tagColors is an array of the same size as tags (with strings of the css color for corresponding tag).
The [users](data/users.json) file holds an array of objects, with each object representing a user.  Each user object has the keys 'username', 'name', 'year', 'school', and 'favclubs'.  Username, name, and school (college within Penn) are strings, year is an int (graduation year), and favclubs is a list of strings (each being the name of a club that user has liked).
The [tags](data/tags.json) file holds an array of all of the string tag names.

## Scraping
I completed [scraper.py](models/scraper.py) and you can rescrape ocwp.pennlabs.org by uncommenting the denoted lines (15-17 inclusive) within [index.py](index.py).  I added some code to color-coordinate equivalent tags for all of the clubs so it is more logically colored on the [clubs page](templates/clubs.html).
